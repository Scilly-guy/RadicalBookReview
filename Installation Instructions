call Update-database from the Package Manager Console with the default project set to RadicalBookApi, this will perform the migration to create the Book table in the local MySQL Database.
Set multiple start up projects in the solutions properties so that both projects start.
Start Debugging The Projects, this should open two browser windows, it will also cause the port numbers to be defined for your machine.
Change the port number on line 17 of RadicalBookApi.Program.cs to the applicationUrl from RadicalBookReview.Properties.launchSettings.json line 6
Change the port number on line 10 "PortOfApi" to the port number on the applicationUrl line from RadicalBookApi.Properties.launchSettings.json line 7
The above two lines prevent a CORS error when the front end requests data from the API, this may be unqiue to my machine due to anti-virus settings, why should requests from the same machine cause a CORS error?

In Visual Studio set both projects to run:
Right click on the solution and select "Set Startup Projects".
Select "Multiple Startup Projects"
Set the action for both the API and RadicalBookReview to Start.
